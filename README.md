# Biochar Toilet

A reliable toilet that could quickly reduce human fecal matter to completely sanitary biochar would make the pooreset people of the
Earth healthier. In many communities, Western-style sewage systems would be very expensive, and impractical for other reasons,
such as geology, the lack of density in farming communities made of small land holdings, a lack of capital, and a lack of
social and political organization able to dig the trenches and lay pipes efficiently.

Reducing a typical human stool to biochar given an energy input of about 600 kilojoules (see detailed analysis in referenced spreadsheet).
Even for the poorest people, the cost of this electricity is quite low---less than one use cent. One kilowatt hour is 3.6 MJ (megajoules).
Expensive electrical power around the world is $0.45/kWh is $0.075 USD--or less than eight cents. Even if our toilet is inefficient, it
seems possible to make toilet whose operating cost is affordable for the poorest persons, at $27.375 per year (this cost does not include
the capital costs of the toilet.)

Biochar can be used a fuel or a garden amendment. Note, however, that human stools are so small that this is not an meaninful approach for carbon sequestration.


# Initial Design Idea
The problem of toilets is a widely researched area. Our approach may be slightly novel. We start from some assumptions:
1. Electicity is an input.
1. Complete biological safety of the endproduct is required.
1. We choose to temporarily ignore the capital costs of the toilet in our research.
1. Because we have to char in the absence of oxygen to prevent combustion, we can assume that we need an air-tight or pressure controlled
    reaction vessel.
1. A major problem in charring is to first dry the sample, and drying is primarily a problem of water transport.

We therefore conclude our basic design will be a sealed reaction vessel with a valve that allow steam to be transported out
of the reaction chamber. We will heat the chamber contents until a desired pressure is created and then transport the water
vapor away by opening the valve. The valve will be controlled so as to avoid most gases (air) from enterring the chamber.
Opening the valve will "flash" the water in the sample into steam, which will have the desirable properties of being
extremely murderous to any organisms present in the sample, and physically destructive to both plant and animal cells.
Possibly it will even physically disrupt the sample, which may be advantageous.

When the sample is sufficiently dry, we will heat it to charring temperature. When the sample is fully charred, and then cooled
and possibly wetted to avoid spontaneous combustion, the
operator will be alerted that the sample is safe to remove and either combust or use as a garden amendment.

# Energy Analysis

Volunter Nupur Bhalla working with Invention Coach Robert L. Read has produced a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZwIqP0B2wM6QrpZTNiK1hNnNmIEIal7qxYdgEJz8Iog/edit?usp=sharing) represnting an energy analysis of the drying and heating process.



# Heating Mechanisms
Since we will have a sealed metal reaction vessel, radio frequency (RF) heating is possibility.
However, it is expected to become less effective as the sample dries.
We therefore intend to explore the possibility of using simple Joule resistive heating of a stainless steel vessel directly.
RF heating, however, has the advantage of heating the sample volumetric (not require conduction), which may be a tremendouse advantage.

# Research Plans

We indent to continue theoretical research and design. Simultaneously, we intend to make a mini-scale system, to test our assumptions
and calculations. That is, we intend to make a very small reaction vessel which can be temperature and pressure controlled, surmounted
with a controllable valve. We will test this system's ability to dry and char small samples of biological material, such as bread.
